### Matt Lucht

I’m a delivery shaped person working with CDPS on the Labs project. 

I’m interested to see how whether the idea of a series of practical, hands-on labs sessions will provide a useful learning experience, and what is needed to ensure these ways of working survive going back into the day-by-day working.
