### Poppy Evans

I am Associate Delivery Manager at CDPS. My role involves delivery management in projects, specifically projects which are Welsh public sector based and aim to develop and improve public services in Wales. I am currently training to be a delivery manager and am learning about agile working and project management. By attending Labs I aim to improve my knowledge of working agile & project management skills. I also aim to work collaboratively with a team to develop a product and use this experience to apply agile working principles and methods that I am learning about. I am interested in learning about how to develop a user based product.
