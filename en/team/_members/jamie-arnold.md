I’m leading the [Learn by Making lab experiment for CDPS](https://learnbymaking.wales).  I’m interested in whether it’s possible to create an environment where people can come together to learn by making things. 

I’m [@itsallgonewrong](https://twitter.com/itsallgonewrong) on Twitter and I write the occasional work related stuff at [https://jamiearnold.com](https://jamiearnold.com)
