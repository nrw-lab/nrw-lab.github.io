### Alaw John

I am the Welsh translator at CDPS. I translate the organisations’ material, I educate people on why we comply with Welsh language Standards, and try to improve the Welsh language services across the country. 

Since joining CDPS in August, I’ve learnt something new every day. Labs is no exception. It’s an opportunity to get out of my comfort zone, immerse myself in new learnings, gain knowledge and create new connections with different people.
