### Gabi Mitchem-Evans

I am a Senior User Researcher at CDPS, it’s my role to make things user-centred. Within labs I aim to share some light-touch ways for teams to apply research and design to their work, and help them put people at the heart of problem solving. 

I am excited to learn more about what the problems look like on the ground and how ‘making’ can give people tools to put UCD into practice!
